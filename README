The MISS terminal was a firmware replacement for Videoton VT-52xxx
line of terminals. They used an Intel 8080 microprocessor. The factory
firmware was exceedingly slow and buggy, so late V. Butenko wrote a
replacement, optimized to work with his OS MISS. In particular,
the X-ON/X-OFF protocol worked reliably on it, so the OS didn't have
to insert any pad characters after long operations, such as line
insert/delete. The screen control protocol was generally compatible
with Videoton VT-52xxx and VT-340 series, but used "MISS Code"
for Cyrillic characters instead of KOI-8. Its lower half corresponded
to KOI-7, with lowercase characters shifted accordinly. The original
control seqences of VT-340 did not have any Western analog (not even
the French Minitel).

This program MTHARD was a software emulator of MISS terminal for IBM PC.
It was emulating "the hardware terminal", as opposing to the abstract
terminal layer in MISS. This way the emulator was compatible with
existing installations where kernels didn't have a "null" or pass-
through terminal. This is why it's not named "MTSOFT" or "MTFIRM".
